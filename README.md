# Text Adventure
Python Terminal Game


The program is a short text-based adventure game.
Where you start out in an empty room with one door that leads you to another room with choices to make that will lead to different endings.
The game has 12 endings, with secrets to uncover and decode.
I will be updating this program to have better and new endings.
